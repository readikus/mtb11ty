# What's a good beginners mountain bike?

## Under 500

# Should I get a dropper?

YES! 

## Tubeless.

## SRAM or Shimano?

# Should I put a fork on my bike that's much longer/shorter than the one that came with it?

Not really. The whole geometry of the bike was thought out and planned by the designers around the fork's length. So changing this is likely to make the bike a bit rubbish.
